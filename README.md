## Core features:
- Supabook implements core CRUD functionality for managing user accounts as well as recipes. 
- Versioning system to allow users to copy recipes and make small changes without having to rebuild it from scratch - version number displayed to show progress

## Next.js
- Server-side rendering of content that is fetched from the database on recipe and user-specific pages as well as handling routing

## Supabase:
 - Postgres database with row-level policies for handling access to rows on user request 
 
## TailwindCSS
 - tailwind for styling with the help of the [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) plugin for nicely styled components 
 
 ## My goals and takeaways 
I set out to learn more about Supabase for this project, and I wasn't dissapointed. Supabase is an awesome alternative to other backend-as-a-service options. Each of the services you get access too are extremely well documented.  

This project was great practice for me in working with Next.js features like server-side rendering for displaying dynamic user data, as an example. I also enjoyed working with and learning about creating row-level policies in the Postgres database for handling access to specific rows with each request.
